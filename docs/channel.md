# Channel

> Like the name mentions, **Channels** separates things by ... channels (surprising I known). 

A channel can be any string like `my_public_channel` or `my_not_so_private_channel`. You can have repeated channels as long as they are in different apps. Also, currently we don't support topics like MQTT with `+` and `#`, a channel is just a string, think of it like and **ID**.
